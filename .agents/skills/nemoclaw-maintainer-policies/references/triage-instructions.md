# NemoClaw Triage Instructions

These instructions are for agents and skills that evaluate NemoClaw issues and PRs before recommending Type, labels, project fields, comments, or follow-up questions.

## Core Rules

- Read `label-taxonomy.md` and `label-taxonomy.json` before suggesting labels.
- Triage from evidence in the item title, body, linked issue, files changed, CI state, and maintainer comments.
- Prefer no label over a guessed label.
- Do not use labels for native issue type, priority, effort, lifecycle status, sprint, or resolution. Daily version labels on issues are tracking and coordination signals only.
- Present dry-run recommendations first unless the agent is already operating inside an explicit authorization context for the proposed write class.
- Keep changes minimal: only add labels or fields that change routing, actionability, or reporting.
- Project Status is a Project field, not a label. Valid values include `No Status`, `Backlog`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Needs Review`, `NV QA`, `Done`, `Won't Fix`, and `Duplicate`.
- Set `human_review_required: true` when the proposed write is outside the current authorization context, has elevated risk, or needs maintainer judgment before execution.
- Normal initial triage should not add inbox or placeholder labels such as `needs: triage`. Use `questions_for_author` without a `needs:*` label when a question is useful but the item is still actionable.
- Never recommend `PRR` during triage. `PRR` is a reserved Product Readiness Review label that maintainers or dedicated PRR workflows apply outside normal triage.

## Issue Flow

1. Classify the issue using native GitHub Issue Type: `Bug`, `Enhancement`, `Task`, `Documentation`, `Epic`, or `Initiative`.
2. Add area labels only when the affected surface is clear.
3. Add platform, provider, or integration labels only with explicit evidence. When a listed integration is named as the affected subject, include the matching `integration:*` label rather than only the broad `area: integrations` label.
4. Add `needs:*` only when an immediate blocking action queue is needed. Do not add `needs: triage` during normal triage.
5. Recommend Project Priority from impact evidence, not user urgency language.
6. Recommend Project Status separately from labels.
7. Ask for missing information when the report is not actionable.
8. Recommend a daily `v0.0.x` label for an issue only when it is useful for daily tracking, regression attention, or "needs PR" coordination.

## PR Flow

1. Identify whether the PR is draft, conflicted, stale, blocked, or review-ready.
2. Apply exactly one PR type label only when enough evidence exists: `bug-fix`, `feature`, `refactor`, or `chore`. Conventional commit prefixes are strong evidence: `fix` maps to `bug-fix`, `feat` maps to `feature`, `refactor` maps to `refactor`, and `chore`, docs-only, CI-only, skill-sync, dependency, packaging, or generated-policy maintenance maps to `chore`.
3. Add `security` when the PR touches credentials, permissions, SSRF, sandbox escape risk, policy enforcement, or trusted installer paths.
4. Add area/platform/provider/integration labels based on files changed and PR intent when useful for review routing.
5. Recommend Project Status `Needs Review` for non-draft, conflict-free PRs that are awaiting maintainer review.
6. Add `needs: rebase` when conflicts or rebase state blocks review.
7. Add `needs: info` only when contributor action is required before review can proceed. If the title, body, linked issue, or files changed provide enough routing evidence, ask optional questions without adding `needs: info`.
8. Daily `v0.0.x` labels activate PRs for daily release work; adding one is not a readiness claim.

## Minimal Labeling

Use the smallest label set that makes the item actionable.

For issues, a high-quality dry run often includes:

- Native Issue Type.
- Zero to two area labels.
- Optional platform/provider/integration labels when directly evidenced.
- Optional blocking `needs:*`; do not add `needs: triage` in normal triage output.
- Project Priority and Status recommendations.
- Optional daily release label only when the issue needs daily tracking, regression attention, or "needs PR" coordination.

For PRs, a high-quality dry run often includes:

- One PR type label.
- Area labels for review routing.
- Optional `security`.
- Optional blocking `needs:*`; do not add `needs: triage` in normal triage output.
- Project Status recommendation.
- Optional daily release label only when the maintainer workflow activates the PR.

## Confidence Thresholds

Use `confidence` in dry-run output:

| Confidence | Meaning | Write Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| `high` | 80%+ confidence; direct evidence supports the recommendation. | Eligible inside an authorization context. |
| `medium` | 70-79% confidence; evidence is plausible but incomplete. | Eligible inside an authorization context with rationale. |
| `low` | Below 70% confidence; evidence is weak or inferred. | Do not write; ask for info or leave unlabeled. |

Never apply a label from a low-confidence inference.

## When To Ask For Info

Use `needs: info` and ask targeted questions only when author action is required before work can proceed:

- A bug report lacks the specific reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, version, environment, or logs needed to route or investigate it.
- A platform-specific claim lacks platform details.
- A provider or integration issue lacks provider/integration configuration.
- A PR does not explain intent, scope, or linked issue and the diff could be interpreted multiple ways.
- A security report lacks enough detail to route safely.

Ask for exact missing fields. Do not ask broad questions like "Can you provide more details?" when specific missing data is known.

## When To Use Needs Labels

- `needs: triage`: Existing inbox or placeholder label for unprocessed items. Normal triage agents should not newly add it once they are producing Type, label, and Project field recommendations.
- `needs: info`: Author action is required before work can proceed; optional clarifying questions alone are not enough.
- `needs: design`: Product or architecture decision is required and implementation cannot proceed from the current report.
- `needs: rebase`: PR cannot proceed because of conflicts or stale base.
- `needs: unblock`: Blocked item needs a decision or dependency resolved.
- `needs: cleanup-review`: Stale, superseded, competing, convergence-needed, or closure-candidate item needs maintainer judgment.

`needs:*` labels are not lifecycle status. Remove them after the requested action is complete.

## Security Handling

- Add `security` when credentials, permissions, authentication, sandbox escape, SSRF, policy bypass, trusted installers, or vulnerability language is present.
- Mark human review required.
- Use neutral language. Do not confirm exploitability in public comments.
- Recommend private disclosure routing when the item appears to describe an undisclosed vulnerability.

## Dry-Run Output

Use this JSON-compatible shape:

```json
{
  "item_number": 123,
  "item_kind": "issue",
  "issue_type_to_set": "Bug",
  "labels_to_add": ["area: install", "platform: macos", "needs: info"],
  "labels_to_remove": [],
  "labels_to_create": [],
  "labels_to_delete": [],
  "issue_fields_to_set": {},
  "project_fields_to_set": {
    "Priority": "Medium",
    "Status": "Backlog"
  },
  "recommended_action": "ask_for_info",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "human_review_required": true,
  "rationale": {
    "issue_type_to_set": "The report describes broken install behavior.",
    "area: install": "The failure occurs during setup.",
    "platform: macos": "The failure appears macOS-specific.",
    "needs: info": "The report lacks NemoClaw and Docker versions."
  },
  "questions_for_author": [
    "Which NemoClaw version are you using?",
    "Which Docker version are you using?",
    "Can you share the full command and error output?"
  ]
}
```

`labels_to_create` and `labels_to_delete` are only for authorized `agt: *` label operations unless a non-agent label operation is explicitly authorized by the current workflow.

## Comment Guidance

- Keep comments to one or two sentences.
- Explain the immediate action or missing information.
- Thank contributors and assume good intent.
- When useful, address the author by GitHub login and reference the specific behavior, PR, or report.
- Be friendly, specific, and direct; do not use generic filler, sarcasm, or frustration.
- Link to existing docs or prior issues when they answer the question better than repeating guidance inline.
- For `needs: info`, ask for exact missing details.
- For security, avoid exploit confirmation.
- For duplicate recommendations, include the canonical item and recommend Project Status or close reason `Duplicate`.
- For superseded or competing-work recommendations, include the canonical or related item if known.
- Use response-specific maintainer guidance for longer community replies, stale handling, closure decisions, or reusable templates.

## Examples

### Bug With Missing Environment

Recommendation:

- Native Issue Type: `Bug`
- Labels: `area: install`, `platform: macos`, `needs: info`
- Priority: `Medium`
- Status: `Backlog`

Comment:

> Thanks for the report. Please share the NemoClaw version, Docker version, macOS version, and the full install error so maintainers can reproduce it.

### Docs Issue

Recommendation:

- Native Issue Type: `Documentation`
- Labels: `area: docs`
- No `documentation` label

### Review-Ready PR

Recommendation:

- Labels: `bug-fix`, `area: cli`
- Project Status: `Needs Review`
- Do not add a daily version label unless the maintainer day workflow activates it.

### Anti-Examples

- Do not add `bug` to a new issue. Set native Issue Type `Bug`.
- Do not add `status: triage` or `needs: triage` from normal triage output.
- Do not add `priority: high`; recommend Project Priority instead.
- Do not treat an issue `v0.0.x` label as release inclusion; PR labels own daily release activation.
- Do not add `needs: review`; use Project Status `Needs Review` for review-ready PRs.
- Do not add `PRR`; it is reserved and must never be suggested by triage instructions.
