NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open source reference stack for running always-on AI agents more safely inside [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) sandboxes.
It provides guided onboarding, a hardened blueprint, routed inference, network policy, and lifecycle management through a single CLI.

**Supported agents:**

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (default)
- [Hermes](https://get-hermes.ai/)

For capabilities, architecture, security controls, and the full feature list, see the [NemoClaw documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/).

## Get Started

Review [Prerequisites](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/get-started/prerequisites.html) before installing.
For Hermes, set `NEMOCLAW_AGENT=hermes` before running the installer, or use the `nemohermes` alias after install.
