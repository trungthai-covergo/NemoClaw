# Patch OpenClaw media fetch for proxy-only sandbox (NVIDIA/NemoClaw#1755).
#
# NemoClaw forces all sandbox egress through the OpenShell L7 proxy
# (default 10.200.0.1:3128). Two layers of OpenClaw must be patched for
# Telegram/Discord/Slack media downloads to work in this environment:
#
# === Patch 1: redirect strict-mode export to trusted-env-proxy ===
# OpenClaw's media fetch path (fetch-ClF-ZgDC.js → fetchRemoteMedia) calls
# fetchWithSsrFGuard(withStrictGuardedFetchMode({...})) unconditionally.
# Strict mode does DNS-pinning + direct connect, which fails in the sandbox
# netns where only the proxy is reachable. Rewriting the fetch-guard module
# export so the strict alias maps to withTrustedEnvProxyGuardedFetchMode
# makes the existing callsite request proxy mode without touching callers.
# The export pattern `withStrictGuardedFetchMode as <letter>` is stable
# across versions while alias letters drift between minified bundles.
# Files that define withStrictGuardedFetchMode locally without an export
# (e.g. mattermost.js) keep their original strict behavior.
#
# === Patch 2: env-gated bypass for assertExplicitProxyAllowed ===
# OpenClaw 2026.4.2 added assertExplicitProxyAllowed() in fetch-guard,
# which validates the explicit proxy URL by passing the proxy hostname
# through resolvePinnedHostnameWithPolicy() with the *target's* SsrfPolicy.
# When the target uses hostnameAllowlist (Telegram media policy:
# `["api.telegram.org"]`), the proxy hostname (e.g. 10.200.0.1) gets
# rejected with "Blocked hostname (not in allowlist)". This is an upstream
# OpenClaw design flaw: a proxy is infrastructure, not a fetch target, and
# should not be filtered through the target's allowlist.
#
# Inject an early-return guarded by `process.env.OPENSHELL_SANDBOX === "1"`
# so the bypass only activates inside an OpenShell sandbox runtime, which
# is what NemoClaw deploys into. OpenShell injects this env var when it
# starts a sandbox pod; any consumer running the same openclaw bundle
# outside an OpenShell sandbox (bare-metal, another wrapper) does not have
# OPENSHELL_SANDBOX set and keeps the full upstream SSRF check. The L7
# proxy itself enforces per-endpoint network policy inside the sandbox,
# so the trust boundary for SSRF protection is unchanged.
#
# Image-level `ENV` does NOT work here: OpenShell controls the pod env at
# runtime and image ENV vars set by Dockerfile are stripped. OPENSHELL_SANDBOX
# is the only marker reliably present in the runtime.
#
# === Patch 2b: allow OpenShell host gateway through web_fetch guard ===
# OpenClaw's web_fetch SSRF guard blocks *.internal hostnames before the
# OpenShell L7 proxy sees the request. NemoClaw users legitimately reach
# host-local approved services through host.openshell.internal after the
# OpenShell policy explicitly allows that host:port. Add this exact hostname
# only to the web_fetch trusted-env-proxy policy, only inside an OpenShell
# sandbox. The generic SSRF helper and strict/direct DNS-pinned paths remain
# unmodified, so metadata/link-local/private IP literals are unchanged.
#
# === Patch 4: route unconfigured strict SSRF fetches through the egress proxy ===
# (NVIDIA/NemoClaw#4687). fetchWithSsrFGuard builds a per-request DNS-pinned
# *direct* undici dispatcher for STRICT-mode fetches that pass no explicit
# dispatcherPolicy — e.g. the @openclaw/googlechat inbound JWT signing-cert
# fetch from www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/metadata/x509/.... A direct
# dispatcher ignores the global EnvHttpProxyAgent installed by
# NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1, so the request never reaches the OpenShell L7 proxy and
# fails in the proxy-only sandbox netns — rejecting every inbound Google Chat
# webhook. OpenClaw already has a "managed proxy" branch that routes such
# fetches through the env proxy (createHttp1EnvHttpProxyAgent) while still
# resolving + SSRF-validating the target hostname, but it is gated on
# isManagedProxyActive() (OPENCLAW_PROXY_ACTIVE=1), which NemoClaw does not set.
# Inside an OpenShell sandbox the configured egress proxy IS the managed proxy,
# so extend that activation to OPENSHELL_SANDBOX=1 for fetches that supply no
# explicit dispatcherPolicy. Explicit-proxy and direct(mTLS) dispatcher policies
# (Google auth proxy / client-cert paths) keep their existing behavior, and
# resolvePinnedHostnameWithPolicy still blocks private/link-local targets.
#
# === Removal criteria ===
# Patch 1: drop when OpenClaw deprecates withStrictGuardedFetchMode or
#   when all media-fetch callsites unconditionally pass useEnvProxy.
# Patch 2: drop when OpenClaw fixes assertExplicitProxyAllowed to skip the
#   target hostname allowlist for the proxy hostname check (or exposes config
#   to disable the check).
# Patch 2b: drop when OpenClaw ships a reviewed web_fetch trusted-proxy SSRF
#   policy surface that can allow host.openshell.internal without allowing
#   broader private/special-use hostnames.
# Patch 4: drop when OpenClaw routes unconfigured strict fetches through the
#   env proxy in proxy-only environments without OPENCLAW_PROXY_ACTIVE, or when
#   NemoClaw sets OPENCLAW_PROXY_ACTIVE=1 in the sandbox runtime instead.
#
# SYNC WITH OPENCLAW: these patches classify the compiled OpenClaw dist at
# build time. They apply the legacy patch when the old target exists, skip
# only when the dist shape proves OpenClaw no longer needs that patch, and
# fail with the OpenClaw version plus dist path for mixed or unknown shapes.
# When bumping OPENCLAW_VERSION, verify the new dist
# takes the expected branch and update the regex / sed replacement if needed.

    # --- Patch 6: cron model-provider preflight opts into trusted env-proxy mode --- \
    # Reviewed against openclaw@2026.5.27 dist: the cron isolated-agent preflight \
    # (`probeLocalProviderEndpoint`) calls `fetchWithSsrFGuard` with \
    # `auditContext: "cron-model-provider-preflight"` and a narrow hostname-allowlist \
    # SsrFPolicy from `buildLocalProviderSsrFPolicy`, but does not pass a `mode`. \
    # Default STRICT mode pins DNS for the managed inference hostname \
    # (`inference.local`), which is intentionally only resolvable through the \
    # OpenShell L7 proxy — pinned `dns.lookup` therefore fails with EAI_AGAIN and \
    # the scheduler permanently skips every cron run. Inject \
    # `mode: "trusted_env_proxy"` so the call uses the env proxy dispatcher; SSRF \
    # protection is retained through the existing hostname allowlist and the \
    # proxy's own ACLs. \
    # \
    # The patch keys on the co-located shape of the reviewed preflight call: in \
    # any file that mentions the audit context literal, both the \
    # `fetchWithSsrFGuard(` helper and the `buildLocalProviderSsrFPolicy` policy \
    # builder must appear; the audit literal itself must appear exactly once; and \
    # after patching exactly one patched literal must remain. Any ambiguous \
    # multi-callsite or mixed patched/unpatched layout fails the image build \
    # rather than silently widening the rewrite. \
    # \
    # Removal condition: drop this block (and any related `OC_VERSION` floor bump) \
    # once an OpenClaw release sets `mode: "trusted_env_proxy"` directly at the \
    # preflight call site or otherwise routes the managed inference base URL \
    # through the env-proxy dispatcher by default. The reviewed shape lives at \

# Patch OpenClaw chat.send gateway behavior for OpenClaw 2026.5.x.

# OpenClaw can accept rapid TUI/WebChat chat.send requests and then emit a
# terminal chat event with state="final" but no assistant message for the later
# submitted run. That makes clients treat the turn as complete even though no
# visible reply was delivered. The shim also correlates real agent run IDs back
# to the submitted chat.send run ID when OpenClaw starts an internal run with a
# different ID, carries that submitted ID through queued follow-up turns, and
# adds the submitted run ID as the transcript idempotency key.
#

# Health check: poll the gateway's /health endpoint so Docker (and Compose)
# can detect and restart unhealthy containers in standalone deployments.
# Ref: https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/1430
#
# Layered probe so Docker health does not contradict the NemoClaw delivery
# chain on runtimes where the dashboard port lives in a different network
# namespace (e.g. DGX Spark / aarch64 with OpenShell-managed forwarding).
# The reporter saw `nemoclaw status` Ready + the host forward succeed while
# Docker marked the container unhealthy because the in-container curl could
# not see the dashboard listener. See #3975.
#
#   1. Direct in-container probe (HTTP 200) — definitive when it works,
#      preserves the original Compose/standalone health signal.
#   2. A connect timeout (curl exit 28) or HTTP 4xx/5xx (curl exit 22) is a
#      real bad signal: a listener exists but is wedged or answered with a
#      failure inside this container, so Docker should restart it.
#   3. ONLY on curl exit 7 ("Couldn't connect" — the kernel refused the
#      in-container TCP connect because nothing is bound to the dashboard
#      port in THIS network namespace) the meaning depends on whether this
#      container is the one running the OpenClaw gateway:
#        a. If nemoclaw-start launched the gateway in this container it
#           drops the /tmp/nemoclaw-gateway-local marker (see
#           scripts/nemoclaw-start.sh). The gateway is local but its port
#           may be forwarded out of this namespace (#3975), so confirm the
#           gateway came up: the process is still alive (pgrep
#           --ignore-ancestors) AND the gateway log is non-empty. A
#           standalone deployment whose gateway never started fails here so
#           Docker restarts it (#1430).
#        b. If the marker is ABSENT the OpenClaw gateway is delivered
#           outside this container (OpenShell docker-driver deployments run
#           it on the host / in a host-side process chain — #4503). An
#           in-container curl/pgrep cannot observe an out-of-namespace
#           gateway, so a process-name fallback here produced false
#           "unhealthy" while `nemoclaw status` and OpenShell reported the
#           sandbox Ready. We must not drive Docker health off a signal we
#           cannot prove: report healthy and defer to NemoClaw/OpenShell's
#           host-side delivery-chain monitoring (verify-deployment.ts, host
#           port forward, sandbox status).
#
# The pgrep pattern matches both `openclaw gateway run` (the launcher
# command nemoclaw-start runs) and `openclaw-gateway` (the older re-execed
# binary form). Recent OpenClaw (v0.0.44 / 2026.5.18+) re-execs the
# long-running gateway into a process whose argv is plain `openclaw` with
# no `gateway` token at all (#4952), which that pattern cannot see — so on a
# marker-present container whose in-container curl probe failed, the stale
# pattern reported a live gateway as permanently unhealthy.
#
# When the pattern misses, fall back to the gateway PID that nemoclaw-start
# recorded in /tmp/nemoclaw-gateway.pid (record_gateway_pid, written for both
# the root and non-root launch paths and refreshed on every respawn) and
# confirm THAT pid is still a live `openclaw` process. This deliberately does
# not match any process merely named `openclaw`: a bare `pgrep -x openclaw`
# would keep Docker healthy when the real gateway has died but an unrelated
# `openclaw` one-shot (e.g. `openclaw agent ...`) happens to be running,
# defeating restart/self-healing. The recorded-pid check is gateway-specific
# and survives PID reuse via the comm prefix guard. `ps -o comm=` reads the
# (15-char) process name, which is `openclaw` for the re-execed gateway and
# `openclaw-gatewa(y)` for the legacy form — both match `openclaw*`.
#
# pgrep uses --ignore-ancestors so it cannot self-match the healthcheck
# shell that Docker spawns to run this CMD — that shell's argv contains
# the literal 'openclaw gateway' string we're searching for, and
# without --ignore-ancestors `pgrep -f` would happily report it as the
# live gateway even after the real process exited (procps 4.0+ supports
# this flag; the base image pins procps to 2:4.0.4-9).
