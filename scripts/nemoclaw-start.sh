# NemoClaw sandbox entrypoint. Runs as root (via ENTRYPOINT) to start the
# gateway as the 'gateway' user, then drops to 'sandbox' for agent commands.
#
# SECURITY: The gateway runs as a separate user so the sandboxed agent cannot
# kill it or restart it with a tampered config (CVE: fake-HOME bypass).
# The config hash is verified at startup to detect tampering.
#
# Optional env:
#   NVIDIA_INFERENCE_API_KEY                API key for NVIDIA-hosted inference
#   CHAT_UI_URL                   Browser origin that will access the forwarded dashboard
#   NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH  Build-time only. Set to "1" to skip device-pairing auth.
#                                  Also auto-disabled when CHAT_UI_URL is non-loopback.
#                                 (development/headless). Has no runtime effect — openclaw.json
#                                 is baked at image build and verified by hash at startup.
#   NEMOCLAW_MODEL_OVERRIDE       Override the primary model at startup without rebuilding
#                                 the sandbox image. Must match the model configured on
#                                 the gateway via `openshell inference set`.
#   NEMOCLAW_INFERENCE_API_OVERRIDE  Override the inference API type when switching between
#                                 provider families (e.g., "anthropic-messages" or
#                                 "openai-completions"). Only needed for cross-provider switches.
#   NEMOCLAW_CONTEXT_WINDOW        Override the model's context window size (e.g., "32768").
#   NEMOCLAW_MAX_TOKENS            Override the model's max output tokens (e.g., "8192").
#   NEMOCLAW_REASONING             Set to "true" to enable reasoning mode for the model.
#                                 Required for reasoning models (o1, Claude with thinking).
#   NEMOCLAW_CORS_ORIGIN           Add a browser origin to allowedOrigins at startup without
#                                 rebuilding. Useful for custom domains/ports (e.g.,
#                                 "https://my-server.example.com:8443").

# ── Agent identity reconciliation with provider routing ───────────
# After the host-side `openshell inference set` swaps the gateway's
# inference provider entry, agents.defaults.model.primary AND the
# in-sandbox models.providers.inference.models[0] entry can both go
# stale: openshell only updates the gateway, not /sandbox/.openclaw/
# openclaw.json. The gateway routes requests to the new model but
# the agent self-reports the old one, and on the next gateway
# reconciliation the file's stale entry can be pushed back, reverting
# the route.
#
# Probe the live gateway via `openshell inference get --json` and
# treat it as the source of truth: when the gateway model differs
# from the file, align both primary and the inference provider's
# first model entry so the agent identity and the gateway route stay
# consistent across the next reconcile cycle.
#
# When the gateway probe is unavailable (no openshell binary, gateway
# unreachable, malformed output), fall back to the legacy in-file
# reconcile so the function still closes primary↔models[0] drift.
#
# Runs after apply_model_override so explicit NEMOCLAW_MODEL_OVERRIDE
# values still win. No-op when already in sync.

# ── Slack runtime env normalization (Bolt-compatible placeholder) ──
# OpenShell injects messaging-provider credentials into the sandbox process
# environment as canonical resolve placeholders, e.g.
#   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=openshell:resolve:env:v51_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
# Unlike the canonical OpenClaw config values (handled by
# refresh_openclaw_provider_placeholders), Slack Bolt validates token *shape*
# at startup and rejects anything that does not begin with xoxb-/xapp-. After a
# messaging-provider rebuild the gateway therefore inherits a placeholder it
# cannot parse and Slack auth fails even though the provider attached
# successfully (NVIDIA/NemoClaw#4274). The L7 egress proxy rewrites the
# Bolt-aliased form (xoxb-/xapp-OPENSHELL-RESOLVE-ENV-*) at request time — the
# same alias the config generator bakes into openclaw.json — so normalize the
# runtime env to that alias before launching OpenClaw.
#
# This runs in the *main* shell (never a subshell / command substitution) so
# the exported values are inherited by the gateway and any one-shot
# "${NEMOCLAW_CMD[@]}" child. Real xoxb-/xapp- tokens and already-aliased values
# are left untouched, so it is safe to call unconditionally and is idempotent.
#
# OpenShell injects self-referential placeholders (the SLACK_BOT_TOKEN env var
# resolves to "openshell:resolve:env:SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" or its revision-scoped
# form "openshell:resolve:env:v<rev>_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"). The match is anchored to
# exactly those two shapes so a placeholder that resolves some *other* key
# (including a suffix collision like ...v1_NOT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN) is left alone
# rather than silently rebound to the Slack secret.

# Node.js 22 sets NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 in the OpenShell base image, which
# intercepts https.request() calls and handles proxying via CONNECT tunnel.
# HTTP libraries (axios, follow-redirects, proxy-from-env) also read
# HTTPS_PROXY and configure HTTP FORWARD mode, double-processing the
# request — the L7 proxy rejects with "FORWARD rejected: HTTPS requires
# CONNECT".
#
# The preload wraps http.request() — the lowest common denominator every
# HTTP client bottoms out at — and rewrites FORWARD-mode requests back to
# https.request() so NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY can handle the CONNECT tunnel.
#
# Earlier PR #2110 intercepted require('axios') via a Module._load hook;
# that could not catch follow-redirects + proxy-from-env bundled as ESM
# in OpenClaw's dist/ (no require() calls to intercept).

# WebSocket CONNECT tunnel fix (NemoClaw#1570).
# The `ws` library calls https.request() for wss:// WebSocket upgrades.
# EnvHttpProxyAgent (NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1) sends a forward proxy request
# instead of CONNECT — rejected by the L7 proxy with 400. Without
# NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY, ws goes direct — blocked by sandbox netns.
# The preload patches https.request() to inject a CONNECT tunnel agent for
# WebSocket upgrade requests. Activates whenever HTTPS_PROXY is set (the
# script itself guards on the env var).

# ── Seccomp syscall guard ─────────────────────────────────────
# OpenShell ≥0.0.36 seccomp policy blocks syscalls like getifaddrs
# (used by Node's os.networkInterfaces()). Third-party libraries (e.g.,
# @homebridge/ciao mDNS) call these without error handling, producing
# unhandled promise rejections that crash the gateway under Node v22's
# default --unhandled-rejections=throw.
#
# This preload catches those specific sandbox-infrastructure errors
# and logs them as warnings instead of letting them kill the process.
# Unlike the Slack channel guard, this is always installed because the
# seccomp-blocked syscalls affect all sandboxes, not just Slack ones.

# OpenShell re-injects narrow NO_PROXY/no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost,::1 every
# time a user connects via `openshell sandbox connect`. Dynamic connect-session
# config lives in /tmp/nemoclaw-proxy-env.sh and is sourced by system-wide shell
# hooks from the base image, keeping per-user rc files free of proxy entries.
#
# SECURITY: The proxy-env file is written via emit_sandbox_sourced_file()
# which ensures root:root 444 in root mode (sandbox cannot modify) and
# best-effort 444 in non-root mode. The /tmp sticky bit prevents the

# is never weakened, and is a no-op when the contract already holds. The
# baseline re-lock stays a root-only startup concern (this runs as the sandbox

# Extract the literal source of a bash function from its defining file.
#
# Uses `shopt -s extdebug` + `declare -F` to look up the function's
# source location, then prints the function definition byte-exact from
# disk. The opener line MUST match ^<name>\(\) \{$ and the body MUST
# end with a single `}` at column 0; every function dispatched through
# run_step_down_as_sandbox follows that style.
#
# This bypasses `declare -f`'s serialiser, which mis-orders the body of
# functions whose `if`/`while`/`until` condition is a here-doc command:
# `declare -f` places the indented `then`-body command immediately after
# the `<<TAG` opener and before the here-doc body. The step-down shell
# then absorbs the displaced command into the here-doc body, leaves the
# `then` block empty, and aborts on the closing `fi` with
#   syntax error near unexpected token `fi'
# Reading the source bytes off disk preserves the original layout and
# is robust to every here-doc shape, not only the
# here-doc-as-last-statement shape `declare -f` happens to round-trip.

# Run one or more locally-defined bash functions as the sandbox user
# without round-tripping through `bash -c "$(declare -f ...) ..."` and
# without going through `declare -f`'s serialiser at all.
#
# The interpolated argv form was fragile because the step-down shell
# could not always re-parse a here-doc-bearing function body carried
# through `bash -c`'s argv. The earlier in-house fix routed function
# bodies through `declare -f` plus a temp file, which removed the argv
# round-trip but kept `declare -f`'s body-reordering bug for here-doc
# `if` conditions. This helper now copies each named function's source
# verbatim from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` (resolved per function via the
# extdebug machinery), so every here-doc shape — condition, body,
# trailing — survives the dispatch unchanged.
#
# The temp script lives directly under /tmp (sticky-bit, world-writable
# but unlink-protected) with an unguessable mktemp suffix, so an
# attacker cannot swap the file between mktemp and the step-down bash
# invocation. The directory is intentionally not configurable.
#
# A `bash -n` syntax check runs on the assembled script before the
# step-down invocation. It is a fail-closed guard: if a future change
# ever produces a malformed temp script (for example, a dispatched
# function that violates the opener/closer style assumption), we abort
# before handing the broken script to step-down, surfacing a clean
# error instead of the obscure `unexpected token 'fi'` failure that
# this helper exists to prevent.
#
# Usage: run_step_down_as_sandbox <invocation-snippet> <fn>...
#
# SECURITY CONTRACT: <invocation-snippet> is appended verbatim to the
# generated bash script and parsed by the step-down shell. It MUST be
# a trusted literal authored alongside this script — never derived
# from environment, file contents, sandbox-uid input, or any
# non-static source. Pass arguments through positional parameters of
# the dispatched functions, not through string interpolation into the
# snippet, and keep the snippet to the minimum set of function calls
# (plus the explicit `export HOME=...` the auth-profile path needs).

# Re-register non-bundled plugins after the gateway's first policy-changed
# regen. Under GPU sandbox onboard, OpenClaw rebuilds plugins[] from bundled
# extensions only and drops path/npm-origin entries like the NemoClaw plugin
# and the WeChat plugin. Their installRecords survive on disk, but the runtime
# registry forgets them — so `/nemoclaw` is unreachable in the TUI and
# `openclaw plugins inspect nemoclaw` says "Plugin not found" (#2021).
# A `plugins registry --refresh` repopulates plugins[] from installRecords.
# Backgrounded so the gateway-wait loop is unblocked; failure is non-fatal.
# Source boundary: the lossy policy-changed rebuild lives in OpenClaw's registry
# regeneration path, outside NemoClaw. NemoClaw can only heal the initial
# post-start registry from persisted installRecords until upstream preserves
# path/npm-origin plugins itself. Later runtime policy mutations are owned by
# OpenClaw's upstream fix, not by this one-shot startup workaround. Remove this
# workaround after openclaw/openclaw#89606 ships and the full onboard E2E still
# proves /nemoclaw registration without the refresh.
